abstract = "Wideband acoustic immittance (WAI) is the name for a collection of measures that characterize sound flow through the middle ear. WAI measurements include impedance, admittance, absorbance, and reflectance. WAI measurements are important in hearing research as they may facilitate development of devices that could assess hearing problems more accurately in a non-invasive manner. A publicly accessible MySQL database of WAI measurements has been created that can be used to access data from published studies. We aim to outline how these WAI data may be described, visualized, and analyzed using methods introduced in introductory or intermediate statistics courses. Through a variety of graphical displays, data wrangling techniques, and modeling, we address a number of statistical questions that can be answered with datasets that have been extracted from the database. An appendix describes how to access the MySQL database to explore other questions as well as to replicate the commands and output in the paper."
