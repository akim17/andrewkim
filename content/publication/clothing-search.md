abstract = "The text genre classification problem is a classic and frequently encountered topic within the field of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. This study applies techniques from text genre classification to the classification of British fiction prose by literary period, Victorian (1830-1900) and Modernist (1900-1930). In addition to using stylometric features considered in my STAT-495 final project, this study takes into particular consideration the use of common word frequencies, frequencies of parts-of-speech unigrams and the frequencies of parts-of-speech trigrams in categorizing texts from these two literary periods. In total, 7 datasets containing a total of 451 variables will be studied in this report. This study will demonstrate the usage of support vector machines (SVM) in the context of text classification, as well as the usage of principal component analysis (PCA) as an exploratory technique for multivariate data analysis. The ultimate goal of this study is to determine whether significant differences exist between Modernist and Victorian works in general and to identify one or several approaches to best separate the works by period. In my analysis, I found that for Datasets 1, 3, 5 and 7, an SVM with 100% accuracy can be found. For Datasets 2, 4 and 6, an SVM with very high accuracy, within 96% and 98% accuracy, can be found."
